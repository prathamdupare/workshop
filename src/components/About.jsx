        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} text-justify max-w-[670px] mt-5`}>
          This unique meeting started in 2001 in USA as “The International
          Symposium on Plant Photobiology” and since then the organisation
          responsibility circulates voluntarily between scientists from Asia,
          the Americas and Europe every two years.
        </p>

        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} text-justify max-w-[670px] mt-5`}>
          It is the single platform where plant photobiology leaders as well as
          upcoming talents across the globe gather on their own interest to
          share their latest mostly unpublished results and discuss future
          directions. This helps the community to exchange up-to-date techniques
          and approaches to address the different biological problems taken by
          the different leading groups. This EMBO workshop on “current trends in
          Photobiology” will bring together researchers from North and South
          America, Europe and Asia to present their latest works on the role of
          photoreceptors as thermo-sensors, how light-perception is linked to
          plant competition, neighbour detection, nutritional uptake, flowering,
          stress response, circadian clocks, and recent advances in new
          optogenetic tools that use light to manipulate cellular signalling.
