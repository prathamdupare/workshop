          are numerous hotels with different budget types present in
          Bhubaneswar. Few prominent ones are -

          January is a very busy month in India, and many conferences generally
          do happen. Therefore, normally the accommodation prices go up
          dramatically, especially in Bhubaneswar. Around this time a doctors
          conference is also happening that would take away space in many hotels
          at an uncompromised price tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          To facilitate your stay and make it enjoyable, we have tried to
          contact a few hotels and gone into discussion several times with
          management to offer a negotiated best price for our delegates. Please
          look into it and decide on your own. These prices are especially for
          ISPP2024 delegates. The details are given below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rooms and prices will be available on a first-cum-first-served
          basis until the blocked rooms are booked away. I Suggest mentioning
          the name of ISPP2024 and NISER to the contact persons and Please pay
          directly to the hotel well in advance and secure your stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will definitely make arrangements for your pickup and drop-off from
          these three hotels to the conference venue. Other participants staying
          in other hotels have to either come to this venue in time or make
          their arrangements to reach the venue.
